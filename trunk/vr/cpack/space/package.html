  <h1>Space Simulation</h1>

  <p>This simulation contains the sun, nine planets, some of their
  moons and ~90k stars.  This is all rendered in proportion to real
  distances and times and is navigable by keyboard and mouse.</p>

  <p>This package is the first test of a design goal to separate scene
  content from the rest of the architecture needed to render and exist
  in a 3D scene.  Where possible, code from org.freality.gui.three.*
  has been used for any such generic scene functionality.</p>

  <p>Until version 1.0, the intended audience for this is java
  developers.</p>

  <p>To run, simply run "java -jar [the version you download]".  This
  will load the datasets remotely, which is fine for a simple demo,
  but very slow given my link speed.  So until I add caching by
  default you may want to download the datasets and put them in your
  classpath.  Which brings us to the todo...</p>

  <h2>Todo for 0.4</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Rings for Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.</li>
    <li>Data display of selected body (a la Celestia).</li>
    <li>Caching of remote datasets; use of near real-time datasets (e.g. atmospherics from NOAA).</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>History</h2>

  <p><em>Current Dev</em> - Fixed moons having same inclination as
  parent planet.  Atmospheres.</p>

  <p>2004-12-30: 0.3 - First major debugging, cleanup and package
  management since 0.1..  Distances and times to scale.  
  <a href="http://www.astronexus.com/general/data/hyg.php">HYG database
  of stars</a> added.</p>

  <p>2004-10-01: 0.2 - After a long pause in development, delayed mainly
  be confusion in code structure, code was reorganized into a main
  package with sub-packages for data and ontological model.  Eliptical
  orbits used and properly oriented around the Sun/parent body.
  Space-ship-ish navigation added.</p>

  <p>2002-08-15: 0.1 - Initial version was inspired by
  <a href="http://shatters.net/celestia/">Celestia</a> and was a first
  cut at using Java3D.  Included the Sun, nine planets, some of their
  moons and random stars.  Wasn't to scale; orbits were circles
  centered on the Sun.  The code wasn't very well split into
  &quot;generic&quot; and &quot;space&quot; modules.</p>

  <p>You can get the code below or from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fmc">FMC SourceForge Project Page</a>.</p>
